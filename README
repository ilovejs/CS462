Collect graph of something interesting. In this case I used wikipedia's graph of around 6 million nodes,
ran a Cloudera + EC2 Hadoop cluster BFS until I reached at least 10,000 nodes, then created the graph using
python's igraph library. See hw1/ subfolder for code & further details.

Part 1: Find interesting sets of my graph and their conductance.
Part 2: Find the first and second eigenvectors of the lazy-walk matrix of my graph. Use this to find sets
        of low conductance.
Part 3: Evolve a random walk until the error of my vector falls below epsilon. At each step find the set
        of lowest conductance.
Part 4: Do the same as Part 3, but choose nodes randomly within the set found in Part 2.

Part 1: Find personal pagerank vectors of graph using different values
        of alpha. Report whether p is well-spread (stop when it is).
Part 2: Use electrical flow to guess at values of function outside a
        randomly chosen set W of G. Compare the error of this to a dumb
        guess.
