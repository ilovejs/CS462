The 20,000 node connected component is in the component subfolder.

BFS.java -- the MapReduce code I ran on AmazonEC2 with Cloudera Hadoop instances
mod_links.py -- turned my 9GB of wikipedia's graph into one formatted for my BFS algorithm
count_nodes.py -- allowed me to count how many nodes were reached in the BFS. Only needed 3 iterations.
collect_nodes.py -- extracted the nodes reached by the BFS. Result was 'connected_component.txt'
create_edgelist.py -- creates edgelist from component
measure_graph.py -- used igraph to measure assortativity and C(2) clustering of resulting graph

shell_sample.txt -- the commands I used to launch a persistent Cloudera Hadoop cluster and output from Hadoop

RESULTS
-------
Nodes 360,085 
Edges 1,595,713
Assortativity: -0.0728834430613
C(2): .562626039742
