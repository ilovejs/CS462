The 20,000 node connected component is in the component subfolder.

BFS.java -- the MapReduce code I ran on AmazonEC2 with Cloudera Hadoop instances
mod_links.py -- turned my 9GB of wikipedia's graph into one formatted for my BFS algorithm
count_nodes.py -- allowed me to count how many nodes were reached in the BFS. Only needed 3 iterations.
collect_nodes.py -- extracted the nodes reached by the BFS. Result was 'connected_component.txt'
convert_component.py -- used igraph to attach metadata and construct graphml file from connected_component.txt
measure_graph.py -- used igraph to measure assortativity and C(2) clustering of resulting graph

RESULTS
-------
Nodes 18,547
Edges 221,187
Assortativity: -0.234
C(2): .614

METADATA
--------
Title and Keywords for each node (wikipedia article)
