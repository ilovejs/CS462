conductance.py -- finds the conductance of the sets containing the words found in the input data
create_graph.py -- creates a tagged version of my graph, mapping <word>->[node set containing <word>]
eigenvectors.py -- finds v1 and v2 and lambda(2) of graph. finds smallest set from v2.
largest_sets.py -- goes through the graph file and finds the largest connected sets containing <word>
walk1.py -- chooses a random node from graph to walk from. calculates smallest conductance at each step.
walk2.py -- chooses a random node from given set to walk from. calculates smallest conductance at each step.
